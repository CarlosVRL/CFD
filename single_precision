# Problem: Find a smallest positive number such that:
#
#   1.0 + e != 1 (not equals)
#
# Similarly, find a largest positive number such that
#
#   1.0 + e = 1
#
# Data types include: float, double, long, 

# Problem Start

# Initialization
e = 1.0

# Main Logic Engine
while (1 + e) > 1:

  # halve the residual at each step
  e = 0.5 * e

  # problem statement met
  break
  
print("The sum 1.0 + e is: {}".format((1+e)))
